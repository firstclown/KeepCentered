# KeepCentered

Sublime Text plugin that will keep the cursor centered in Distraction Free Mode (requires [FullScreenStatus](https://github.com/maliayas/SublimeText_FullScreenStatus))

This plugin mimics the Scrivener full screen feature that keeps the current line of text centered on the screen. It will only work in Distraction Free mode, so that SublimeText will continue to work normally when it's not full screen.

I use this for fiction writing, but you can use it for anything really.
